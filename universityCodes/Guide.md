The following gives a description of what each coding exercise is about.
## Ex1
This is the first set of exercises I did in Matlab, therefore it is a series of **simple** exercises such as creating the **Identity Matrix**, **matrix of random numbers**, and **an individual matrix out of another matrix**.  
Moreover, it was asked  to do some opeartion on the values of these matrices: 
calculating **mean**, performing **element by element** operations, etc.
## Ex2
In this exercise,it was asked to **read from files(![csv file](https://github.com/Roxa-na/matlabProjects/blob/main/universityCodes/Ex2/input_file.csv))**, **plot** and save the **plots** in different formats, such as **jpeg** and **fig.** Moreover, for some examples mathematical computation on vectors were done.
## Ex3
The focus of this exercise is on **Reading from files**, **plotting** and creating **suplots**, also saving the plots as jpeg files. Additionally, for a sine wave, **noise signals** were created and **applied on** the signal. For the last part of the exercise some processing on the data was done as well; a **threshold** for a signal was defined and **histograms** for **certain intervals** were plotted. 
## Ex4
In this exercise, programs with the control structures, such as **if-else** and **switch-case** were coded. Most of these control structures were written for the data that was obtained from a ![csv file](https://github.com/Roxa-na/matlabProjects/blob/main/universityCodes/Ex4/num_value.csv).
## Ex5
In this exercise, **loop structures** for different examples were written and the use of **vetorization** instead of loops for certain cases were investigated.
## Ex6
In this exercise, **matlab custome functions** for different examples were written. Moreover, the execution time of **nested-for-loops** approach and the **vectorized** one for the multiplication of large matrices were measured. 
## Ex7
This was the last project that was done. A **GUI program** was created that generated waveforms for **sine** and **cosine** function. The program got the **amplitude**, **frequency**, and **number of periods** that user wanted to see. Also, the program gave the option of adding **noise** to the waveform. The amount of noise could be controlled by percentage. At the end, the waveform could be saved via a save button. The GUI looks like the photo below.
