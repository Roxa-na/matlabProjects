The following gives a description of what each code is about.
## Ex1
This is the first set of exercises I did in Matlab, therefore it is a series of **simple** exercises such as creating the **Identity Matrix**, **matrix of random numbers**, and **an individual matrix out of another matrix**.  

Moreover, it was asked  to do some opeartion on the values of these matrices: 
calculating **mean**, performing **element by element** operations, etc.
## Ex2
It was asked to **read from files(csv file)**, **plot** and save the **plots** in different formats, such as **jpeg** and **fig.** Moreover, for some examples mathematical computation on vectors were done.
## Ex3
The focus of this exercise is on Reading from files, plotting and creating suplots. also saving the plots as jpeg files.
## Ex4
In this exercise, programs with the control structures, such as **if-else** and **switch-case** were coded. 
## Ex5
In this exercise, loop structures for different examples were written and the use of vetorization instead of loops for certain cases were investigated.
## Ex6
In this exercise, **matlab cutome functions** for different examples were written. Moreover, the execution time of **nested-for-loops** approach and the **vectorized** one for the multiplication of large matrices were measured. 
## Ex7
This was the last project that was done. A GUI program was created that generated waveforms for sine and cosine function. The program got the amplitude, frequency, and number of periods that user wanted to see. Also, the program gave the option of adding noise to the waveform. The amount of noise could be controlled by percentage. At the the end the waveform coud be saved via a save button.
