The following gives a description of what each code is about.
## Ex1
This is the first set of exercises I did in Matlab, therefore it is a series of **simple** exercises such as creating the **Identity Matrix**, **matrix of random numbers**, and **an individual matrix out of another matrix**.  

Moreover, it was asked of us to do some opeartion on the values of these matrices: 
calculating **mean**, performing **element by element** operations, etc.
## Ex2
Reading from files(csv file), plotting and storing the plots in different formats were done in this exercise.
## Ex3
Reading from files, plotting and creating suplots. also saving the plots as jpeg files.
## Ex4

## Ex5

## Ex6
In this exercise, **matlab cutome functions** for different examples were written. Moreover, the execution time of **nested-for-loops** approach and the **vectorized** one for the multiplication of large matrices were measured. 
## Ex7
